# Exercise 1: Vowel or Consonant
#
# Write a Python function named `check_letter` that determines if a given letter
# is a vowel or a consonant.
#
# Requirements:
# - The function should prompt the user to enter a letter (a-z or A-Z) and determine its type.
# - It should handle both uppercase and lowercase letters.
# - If the letter is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), print: "The letter x is a vowel."
# - If the letter is a consonant, print: "The letter x is a consonant."
# - Replace 'x' with the actual letter entered by the user.
#
# Hints:
# - Use the `input()` function to capture user input.
# - Utilize the `in` operator to check for vowels.
# - Ensure to provide feedback for non-alphabetical or invalid entries.

def check_letter():
    # Your control flow logic goes here
    vowel =['a','e','i','o','u']
    letter = ""

    while not letter.isalpha() or not len(letter)==1:
        letter = input("Enter a letter: \n")
        if not letter.isalpha() or not len(letter)==1:
            print("Sorry, invalid entry")

    if letter.lower() in vowel:
        print( f" The letter {letter} is a vowel")
    else:
        print(f"The letter {letter} is a consonant.")

    

# Call the function
check_letter()


# Exercise 2: Old enough to vote?
#
# Write a Python function named `check_voting_eligibility` that determines if a user is old enough to vote.
# Fill in the logic to perform the eligibility check inside the function.
#
# Function Details:
# - Prompt the user to input their age: "Please enter your age: "
# - Validate the input to ensure the age is a possible value (no negative numbers).
# - Determine if the user is eligible to vote. Set a variable for the voting age.
# - Print a message indicating whether the user is eligible to vote based on the entered age.
#
# Hints:
# - Use the `input()` function to capture the user's age.
# - Use `int()` to convert the input to an integer. Ensure to handle any conversion errors gracefully.
# - Use a conditional statement to check if the age meets the minimum voting age requirement.

def check_voting_eligibility():
    # Your control flow logic goes here
    VOTING_AGE = 18
    age = 0

    while True:

        age = input("Please enter your age:\n")

        if age.isdigit() and int(age) >= 0:
            break
        else:
            print("Sorry, invalid entry.")
        

    if int(age) >= VOTING_AGE:
        print("You are eligible to vote")

    else:
        print("You are not eligible to vote")


# Call the function
check_voting_eligibility()


# Exercise 3: Calculate Dog Years
#
# Write a Python function named `calculate_dog_years` that calculates a dog's age in dog years.
# Fill in the logic to perform the calculation inside the function.
#
# Function Details:
# - Prompt the user to enter a dog's age: "Input a dog's age: "
# - Calculate the dog's age in dog years:
#      - The first two years of the dog's life count as 10 dog years each.
#      - Each subsequent year counts as 7 dog years.
# - Print the calculated age: "The dog's age in dog years is xx."
# - Replace 'xx' with the calculated dog years.
#
# Hints:
# - Use the `input()` function to capture user input.
# - Convert the string input to an integer using `int()`.
# - Apply conditional logic to perform the correct age calculation based on the dog's age.

def calculate_dog_years():
    # Your control flow logic goes here
    
    while True:
        dog_age = input("Input a dog's age: ")

        if dog_age.isdigit() and int(dog_age)>0:
            break
        else:
            print("Sorry, invalid entry.")

    int_dog_age =int(dog_age)
    if int_dog_age <3:
        dog_year = int_dog_age *10
    
    else:
        dog_year = 20+ (int_dog_age-2)*7

    print (f"The dog's age in dog years is {dog_year}")


# Call the function
calculate_dog_years()
